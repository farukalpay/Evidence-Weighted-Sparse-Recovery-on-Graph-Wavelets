# Evidence-Weighted Sparse Recovery on Graph Wavelets

*A Compressive Sensing Framework for Text Classification (SMS Spam)*

## Executive Summary

This repository implements a compressive-sensing-inspired pipeline that maps raw SMS text to **graph-wavelet** features and performs **evidence-weighted sparse recovery** under covariate shift. Using the UCI SMS Spam Collection, the framework attains **Accuracy between 0.867 and 0.966**, **F1 between 0.678 and 0.878**, and **AUC between 0.931 and 0.964** across diverse regimes. Importance weighting (uLSIF) plus evidence weighting improves robustness in hard-shift settings and sharpens interpretability by emphasizing monetary/regulatory spam markers.

---

## Method at a Glance

**Pipeline**

```
Text → tokens → word co-occurrence graph (PMI edges)
     → Laplacian → Chebyshev-approximated heat-kernel wavelets (multi-scale)
     → best-basis selection via entropy
     → density-ratio estimation (uLSIF)
     → evidence weights (message quality cues)
     → weighted ℓ₁ recovery (LassoCV)
     → sparse, interpretable classifier
```

**Objective**

Let Φ be the feature matrix (graph-wavelet dictionary), y∈{0,1}ⁿ the labels (spam=1), and W=diag(w⊙λ) the product of **importance weights** *w* (uLSIF) and **evidence weights** *λ* (quality). We solve

[
\hat{\beta} = \arg\min_\beta \tfrac{1}{2}| \sqrt{W}(y - \Phi\beta)|_2^2 ;+; \lambda|\beta|_1.
]

**Key ideas**

* **Graph wavelets** compress co-occurrence structure and spread signal across scales.
* **uLSIF** (unconstrained least-squares importance fitting) mitigates dataset shift.
* **Evidence weighting** down-weights low-quality or noisy messages, improving calibration.
* **Entropy best-basis** selects the most compressible wavelet stack (proxy for sparsity).

---

## "Best Of" Shortlist (replicable)

The following are the most useful configurations from a *practitioner* standpoint: strong overall accuracy, demonstrable shift-robustness, and high interpretability. Commands and expected metrics come from the logs reproduced below.

1. **Best Overall (default) — clean, high accuracy & AUC**

```bash
python main.py
```

* **Expected:** F1 ≈ 0.856, **Acc ≈ 0.966**, AUC ≈ 0.960
* **Why this is good:** Already near the dataset's ceiling; evidence weighting offers small but consistent refinement with negligible tuning.

2. **High Covariate Shift (importance weighting helps)**

```bash
python main.py \
  --window 1 --pmi_shift 1.4 --cheb_order 24 \
  --max_vocab 1800 --min_df 5 --biased_samples 500
```

* **Expected:** **F1 0.678 → 0.695**, Acc 0.930 → 0.932, AUC 0.934 → 0.936
* **Why this is good:** Clear BEFORE→AFTER improvement under severe shift (w=1 and aggressive PMI shift). Demonstrates the intended benefit of uLSIF+evidence.

3. **Production-Optimized (larger subset; strong raw F1 BEFORE)**

```bash
python main.py \
  --max_rows 3000 --biased_samples 900 \
  --window 1 --pmi_shift 1.3 --cheb_order 20 \
  --max_vocab 2000 --min_df 3
```

* **Expected:** F1 ≈ 0.875 → 0.860, Acc ≈ 0.923 → 0.916, AUC ≈ 0.964 → 0.962
* **Why still valuable:** High baseline performance; AFTER down-weights outliers and tightens coefficients (useful for calibration/interpretability even with a small F1 drop).

Mean |coef| BEFORE=9.3593e-03 AFTER=9.1784e-03
```

**Why AFTER is (slightly) better**

* The dataset is well-behaved; the baseline is already near its limit.
* uLSIF mildly corrects length-driven sampling bias; evidence weights shave noisy outliers.
* The slight drop in mean |coef| indicates gentler, cleaner support without losing AUC.

**Strengths**

* Out-of-the-box high accuracy and AUC.
* Minimal tuning; stable best-basis choice (scales (0.5,1.0)).

**Weaknesses**

* Only marginal gains from weighting (low shift scenario).

Mean |coef| BEFORE=1.1202e-02 AFTER=1.2037e-02
```

**Why BEFORE is better**

* With a moderate projection and smaller sample, uLSIF can over- or under-compensate local density, *inflating* some coefficients (mean |coef| ↑).
* Evidence weights help, but here the density-ratio fit error dominates → slight metric decline.

**Strengths**

* BEFORE: stronger F1/AUC; simpler.
* AFTER: still competitive; sometimes preferable for interpretability (more conservative support is *not* observed here, but see other configs).

**Weaknesses**

* AFTER degrades when the DR model is high-variance relative to sample size.

**Why BEFORE is better**

* Extremely narrow co-occurrence window and aggressive PMI shift reduce context; DR estimation runs on a compressed projection and may underfit.
* AFTER has more regularized coefficients (mean |coef| ↓), improving calibration but giving up a slice of raw F1.

**Strengths**

* BEFORE: higher F1; AFTER: crisper support (useful for explanations).

**Weaknesses**

* With limited context, importance weighting needs more target coverage or milder kernel settings.

**Why AFTER is better**

* Severe distribution shift (tight window, higher PMI threshold) advantages **importance weighting**: the reweighted empirical risk better matches the test distribution.
* AUC also improves, indicating improved ranking quality.
* Mean |coef| ↑ reflects that AFTER pushes more weight onto *true* spam cues (monetary/regulatory).

**Strengths**

* Textbook demonstration of uLSIF's value under shift.
* Better F1 and AUC simultaneously.

**Weaknesses**

* Slightly larger coefficients can over-specialize if pushed further; keep DR model modest.

Chosen scales: (0.5, 1.0) | Chebyshev order: 28
Biased sample size: 350 / Train size: 1235
Entropy scores per scale-set: [6.8972, 7.2128, 6.9802]
Mean |coef| BEFORE=4.0408e-02 AFTER=3.7675e-02
```

**Why BEFORE is (slightly) better**

* The compact vocabulary plus strong wavelet order yields very discriminative unweighted features; DR adds variance without enough upside.
* AFTER reduces |coef| (regularization/calibration), costing a touch of F1/AUC.

**Strengths**

* BEFORE produces the **highest raw F1** among reported runs.
* AFTER improves calibration and interpretability (smaller, cleaner support).

**Weaknesses**

* AFTER loses a little discrimination in this already-easy regime.

**Why AFTER is mixed (F1 ↑, AUC ↓)**

* Importance weighting improves thresholded classification (F1, Acc) but slightly harms ranking consistency (AUC).
* Coefficients enlarge (mean |coef| ↑), suggesting stronger specialization to reweighted spam patterns.

**Strengths**

* Better F1 and Acc, i.e., operational improvements at a fixed threshold.

**Weaknesses**

* AUC drop warns about ranking robustness; recalibrate threshold or regularize DR.

Chosen scales: (0.5, 1.0) | Chebyshev order: 20
Biased sample size: 900 / Train size: 1685
Entropy scores per scale-set: [7.7358, 8.0536, 7.8184]
Mean |coef| BEFORE=2.3625e-02 AFTER=1.6293e-02
```

**Why BEFORE is better**

* With already robust coverage, DR reweighting yields diminishing returns; evidence weights shrink coefficients (mean |coef| ↓) and improve calibration, but cost F1/Acc.

**Strengths**

* BEFORE: excellent F1/AUC; AFTER: sparser, more stable coefficients for production explanation/reporting.

**Weaknesses**

* AFTER may be unnecessary unless calibration and interpretability are prioritized.

---

## Feature Evolution (Why interpretability improves)

Across runs, **AFTER** consistently elevates **monetary and regulatory markers**—e.g., `£1000, 150ppm, prize, cash, POBOX, claim code`, and **urgency** tokens (`URGENT, Valid 12hrs, GUARANTEED`)—while suppressing diffuse, generic words (`news, mobile, tones`). This aligns with the intended effect of **density-ratio × evidence** weighting: de-emphasize sampling artifacts; promote features with **stable discriminative signal** across distributions.

---

## Best-Basis (Entropy) Behavior

The selector repeatedly chooses **(0.5, 1.0)** as the wavelet scale set, with the lowest entropy among candidates:

| Scale Set       | Typical Entropy (↓ better) | Selection |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| (0.5, 1.0)      | 6.90–8.25                  | ✓         |
| (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) | ~7.89–8.57                 |           |
| (1.0, 2.0, 4.0) | ~7.66–8.35                 |           |

Lower entropy ↔ more compressible coefficient energy distribution ↔ better sparse recovery and interpretability.

---

## Practical Guidance

* **When to prefer AFTER (weights on):** noticeable train/test mismatch, tight windows (w=1), aggressive PMI shift; need for **calibration** and **explanations**.
* **When to prefer BEFORE (weights off):** large, well-covered training slice; strong raw discrimination; minimal shift.
* **Tuning order:** window → PMI shift → Chebyshev order. Keep DR kernel grids modest to avoid high variance.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'`**
  Install dependencies as listed above.

* **`ValueError: probabilities do not sum to 1` (during biased sampling)**
  Ensure probabilities for the train indices are normalized. The current code normalizes `prob_train = prob_train / prob_train.sum()` before sampling.

* **Pandas deprecation warning on `GroupBy.apply`**
  Harmless; future versions may require `include_groups=False` or explicit column selection.

---

## Complexity (Order-of-Magnitude)

* Graph build: **O(n · d² · w)** (docs × squared length × window)
* Wavelets (Chebyshev): **O(K · |E|)**
* uLSIF: **O(m³)** for ridge solve over kernel centers *m*
* Weighted LASSO: **O(p · n_eff · log p)** (coordinate descent)

---

## Data

* **Dataset:** UCI ML Repository — SMS Spam Collection
* **Size:** 5,574 messages (747 spam, 4,827 ham)
* **Preprocessing:** lowercase, stopword removal, rare-token filter
* **Vocabulary:** 500–3000 tokens depending on `--max_vocab` and `--min_df`
